# LH-LargeCrappyMaps

A collection of my 100x100 grid maps for FoundryVTT created with DungeonDraft, FoundryVTT and the FoundryVTT modules Levels and Better Roofs.

If you are watching me stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lordhaywire) then you can download the files I started working on at the beginning of the stream from the [streaming](https://github.com/lordhaywire/lh-largecrappymaps/tree/streaming) branch.

This does not include the DungeonDraft files because you would need to be using the same assets as me and I think it would just turn into a big clusterfuck.
