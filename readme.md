# LH-LargeCrappyMaps

A collection of my 100x100 grid maps for FoundryVTT created with DungeonDraft, FoundryVTT and the FoundryVTT modules Levels, Better Roofs and wall-height.

If you are watching me stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lordhaywire) then you can download the files I started working on at the beginning of the stream from the [streaming](https://github.com/lordhaywire/lh-largecrappymaps/tree/streaming) branch.

This does not include the DungeonDraft files because you don't need them for the FoundryVTT version but I have included them in another repository called [dungeondraft-maps](https://github.com/lordhaywire/dungeondraft-maps).  I have not tested that they work with another person.  They require purchased assets to work.
