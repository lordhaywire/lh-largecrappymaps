# LH-LargeCrappyMaps

A collection of my 100x100 grid maps for FoundryVTT created with DungeonDraft, FoundryVTT and the FoundryVTT modules libWrapper, Levels, Better Roofs,and wall-height.

The maps should work with any RPG system.

If you are watching me stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lordhaywire) then you can download the files I started working on at the beginning of the stream from the [streaming](https://github.com/lordhaywire/lh-largecrappymaps/tree/streaming) branch.

This repository does not include the DungeonDraft files because you don't need them for FoundryVTT but I have included them in another repository called [dungeondraft-maps](https://github.com/lordhaywire/dungeondraft-maps).  

I also added a [Discord](https://discord.gg/NfVdrnwEQ4) if you want to talk about the maps!

All assets are from [Forgotten Adventures](https://www.patreon.com/forgottenadventures).  You should check them out!

## Dependancy Modules in FoundryVTT

## Installation

Download the zip file from the repository.

Extract the folder from the zip file and copy it into your modules folder.

The folder must be called lh-largecrappymaps.

Start FoundryVTT and go to Settings > Manage Modules.  Find Lord Haywire's Large Crappy Maps and select it.  If you have the other dependancies already installed it will ask you to enable them.  If you don't have the other dependancies installed then you will need to download them first through Foundry's Add-on Modules tab.

If you need help feel free to ask!  You can find me in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/NfVdrnwEQ4) channel.

## Maps

All maps are 100x100 grid squares at 100 pixels and have lighting and roofs.

## Work in Progress Maps (WIP)

If the map has WIP in front of it then it is a work in progress and may be in any state including completely broken.  The WIP files are included so people can look at what I am doing while I stream.

Foundry makes it difficult without doing a bunch of work later to move maps around in folders, so I have a hidden folder for testing that you might see in my stream.  

It isn't important.

## Known issues

All the maps take a significant time to load and sometimes the clients connected to the maps require the player to draw a box for the maps to actually show up on their side.

### Lighting

At some point I am going to make all the lighting the same on all the maps, but I sort of winged it when I first started making maps.  I also haven't decided on which lighting I like the best so whenever that happens I may update the lighting on all the maps.

### Farms North South

Farmland with a road running from the north to the south.

#### Lighting

Torch/Lantern Etc Light Color - #e6620a - 60/30

Candle - #e6620a- 5 dim

#### Known Issues

None!

### Western Town East West

An old west style town with an underground dungeon level.  There is a road running east west.

#### Known Issues

This map has a shit ton of walls.  Like thousands of walls because of all the trees.  It takes a long while to load.  It isn't really an issue, as it can't be fixed and is just how my maps are.

### Bridge Town North South

A town on two sides of a river with a bridge that runs across the river.  There is an underground level with basements, passages, and a cavern.  The road runs north south.

#### Known Issues

Most of the issues with the Levels FoundryVTT module have been fixed, but sometimes the roofs don't disappear when a token goes under them.  There isn't really anything that can be done about that because it is a FoundryVTT issue.  If you noticed other issues please put in an issue on this github!

#### Lighting

Torch/Lantern Etc Light Color - #e6620a - 60/30

Candle - #e6620a- 10 dim/5 bright

### WIP - City Center

At some point this is going to be a city center.

### WIP - Fort on Hill

A fort on a hill with a large underground area in the hill.

### WIP - Hole

A massive 24 level hole in the ground.  I imagine it is going to break Foundry.

Underground walls are Cliff Stone Volcanic B1. Most is x2 size.

Underground edge is Cave Wall Top Path.

Underground floor is Gravel 05 E.

Underground room floors are Rock Tile A2.

Lava D.
